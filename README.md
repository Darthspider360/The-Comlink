## Responsivity 
To make sure that the site was responsive across all devices I built it mobile first as this is most likely where people in a crisis will access the site.

## Deployment
I deployed my site using github and github pages. These are the steps I did:

1. Logged into my GitHub account
2. Went to the BandAid repository
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu I navigated to the Pages button
5. In the Source section I chose 'main' from the drop-down
6. I selected 'root' from the drop-down folder menu in branch menu
7. I saved adn then waited a short while for the link to be generated.
