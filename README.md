A long time ago in a galaxy far far away, the arma 3 community created the 501st unit. Along with their fellow GARC units, they created a proud community of star wars simulator fans. The Comlink is a place where the clones can converse with each other and share images/videos from their antics.

## Basics

### Naming
To begin with, I was uncertain what to call this social media site as I wanted it to relate to Star wars and the community. While thinking about quotes from the films i realised that there could only be one name - Comlink. This is the device usedd across the galaxy to communicate to one another and so this fits perfectly with the idea and theme of the service.
### User Stories 
Since creating user stories is a weak point for me, I decided to have Microsoft Copilot help me out.

### User Stories: Criteria
The majority of the provided user stories fit very well and so I asked Copilot to create the criteria for each.

### User Stories: Isssues
From what Copilot provided me, I tweaked the wording of some of them and then added them to the issues section od GitHub. I created a user story template to do this much faster.

Once the issues were made, I added them to my project board and assigned them labels for their priority.

## User Design
Since this site is heavily influenced by Star Wars, I wanted to keep the styling similar to the main colours used for their graphics - this is where the black and yellow come from on the pallete.
Since this site is aimed for the 501st unit (which I am a part of) I wanted to include more colours that connect to the unit specifically. For those that know Star Wars, they will know that their colours are blue (on top of the clone trooper white). For those that don't - here is a photo of Commander Rex to show his colours:

and here is a snippet from the offical Star Wars wiki page:

Using this photo and some research the closest blue I could link was French blue and so, combining all the colours together I created this pallete using Coolors.

While planning I wasn't 100% certain how many colours I would need and so keeping on the Star wars theme I went to get more colours - just in case.

## Responsivity 
To make sure that the site was responsive across all devices I built it mobile first as this is most likely where people in a crisis will access the site.

## Deployment
I deployed my site using github and github pages. These are the steps I did:

1. Logged into my GitHub account
2. Went to the BandAid repository
3. Click the Settings button near the top of the page
4. In the left-hand menu I navigated to the Pages button
5. In the Source section I chose 'main' from the drop-down
6. I selected 'root' from the drop-down folder menu in branch menu
7. I saved adn then waited a short while for the link to be generated.
